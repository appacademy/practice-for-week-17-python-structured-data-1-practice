#  Merge Two Lists

# Given two lists, lst1 and lst2, write a function merge_lists that merges them
# into a dictionary where the lst1 represents a list of the keys and lst2
# represents a list of the values. Assume the lists are of the same length.


# Your code here


lst1 = ['a', 'b']
lst2 = [1, 2]

print(merge_lists(lst1, lst2))      # { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 }
